# DeepLearning
Deep learning is an area of machine learning focus on using deep which contains more than one hidden layer of Artificial Neural Networks, which are inspired by the human brain.Deep learning is applicable over a range of fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing.

**Artificial Neural Network**
ANN's are inspired from biological neural processing network of Neurons in our brain.Basically a neron takes inputs through dentrides, process the information and send output through axons.Connections between neurons take place through synapses.Below diagram of biological neuron of brain.![Screenshot](Neuron.png)

Perceptron can have two output values 0 or 1.A single layer perceptron will have no hiden layers.Multilayer perceptron will have hidden layers like in the figure shown below.ANN are generally feed forward networks.
